# CSS exercise 38: Keyframe animations

You've asked for looping and infinite animationsâ€¦ that's what Keyframe Animations are for!

No need for a higher-specificity selector to drive them too, you can set animations on the base styles of any element.

1. What makes the keyframes code different to the rest of CSS?
1. How do we use a keyframe animation we set up earlier as a property in a ruleset for an element?
1. Keyframe animations have other keywords that aren't available in `transitions`, what are these keywords?
1. How many properties can we animate at once?
1. What properties are animatable?

 3)We use animation-name,animation-duration ,default of animation 0. 

 4) Keyframe' s keywords from and to or 0% till 100% .revers,altern,infinite,alternate-reserve,pause ,running .
