/*1 Inheritance is a root of CSS and It works with html markup (inherit properties) which are from their parent
  elements and and pass them on to their children.*/
 /*1 When applied to an element in a document, a property with the value
  'inherit' will use the same value as the parent element has for that property. The background colour
  of the div element is white, because the background-color property is set to white.*/
/*
Here below is a list without the aural-oriented properties, now including CSS3 properties.
border-collapse.
border-spacing.
caption-side.
color.
cursor.
direction.
empty-cells.
font-family.

/*currentColor is useful when you want a certain color to be consistent in an element.
For example, if you want an element to have a border color that’s the same as the element’s text color,
using currentColor makes
 a lot of sense because then if you decide the main text color you can change the value at only one place*/
/*If used by a site's own styles (the author origin), revert rolls back the property's cascaded value to the user's custom style, if one exists; otherwise, it rolls the style back to the user agent's default style.
If used in a user's custom stylesheet, or if the style was applied by the user (the user origin), revert rolls back the cascaded value to the user agent's default style.
If used within the user agent's default styles, this keyword is functionally equivalent to unset.*/
