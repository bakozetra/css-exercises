# CSS exercise 40: Shadows

There are two types of shadows:

1. Box Shadows, or the shadows that run around or inside a box
1. Text Shadwos, or the ghostly shadow outlines of text.

Let's do some research on these shadowsâ€¦

1. `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` have very similar value syntax. Where do they differ?
1. If I wanted to create a hard-edge shadow, one that looks like a solid border, what combination of values would I need to use?
1. Is it possible to create a shadow on a circular element? What about a polygon?
1. Is it possible to create multiple shadows on the same element?
   
   1) we can use thickenness with  text shadow but we can not use inset in it .We can use inset in box shadow but we can not use thickenness on it too.

   2) We have to use X , y ,thickennes and color.

   3)yes it ,we can not use polygon in shadow.

   4) yes ,we can mutiply it but we have to use commat  in between theim.
