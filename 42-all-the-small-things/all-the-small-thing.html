 <b>outline :</b> We can use outline if you want to decorate your border.
 I want to mention that outline  and border are same but even that ,there must be differnce between both.<u>Defferenciation between outline and border:</u>
  <br>Outlines never take up space, as they are drawn outside of an element's content.
  <br>According to the spec, outlines don't have to be rectangular, although they usually are. 
  <br> Outline doe not affect with width.

 <b>`:focus`</b> represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's "tab" key.
We have to use focus on style.
</p>
<p>
  <b>:focus-within</b> represents an element that has received focus or contains an element that has received focus. In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the :focus pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by :focus.
 
</p>
<p>
  <b>:visited</b> represents links that the user has already visited. For privacy reasons, the styles that can be modified using this selector are very limited.

  <b>:target</b>represents a unique element (the target element) with an id matching the URL's fragment.
</p>
<p>
  <b>:disabled : </b> pseudo-class represents any disabled element. An element is disabled if it can't be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus. The element also has an enabled state, in which it can be activated or accept focus.
