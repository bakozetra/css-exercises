/*
1) The default value of position is static

2) We have to use top ,right,left,bottom,(width,height)

3)The `position` still maintains a box in the flow of the document is sticky.

4)Fixed positioning is a special from of  absolute

position:fixed is to fixe the viewport and It is out of the flow of the rest of the document.
 We should be careful with fixe thougg because it takes the element out of the document flow.
position:sticky  is scrolls along like anything else until it reaches the offset that you set

5)The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element.

6)


  7)absolutely positioned descendants ,it gives you control that me
 An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
 (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
  However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors,
  it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

  8)

  9)A stacking context is created when an element is positioned and assigned a z-index value other than auto , or when an element has an opacity value less than 1.
