/*
1)One column a  grid have by default.

2)The difference between flexbox and grid:-flexbox was for one dimension like row or column
                                          -grid was for two-dimentional like row and column at the same time.

3)I would like to use flexbox than grid because I can control a single dimenson  row or column andThe justify-content property determines how the extra space of the flex-container
 is distributed to the flex-items,
 but for grit I can not do that because grid arranges multiple row and column .

 4)I would like to se grid  because it is the best for arranging elements in multiple rows and columns.

 5)  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 10rem); this is the more concise way to write grid .

 6)we are using minmax.
