    display The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
  <b>Box-sizing</b> CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.
We can use content box and border box on it .

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>width</b> = margin-left + border-left-width + padding-left + width + padding-right + border-right-width + margin-right
  </p>
  <p>

    <b>display: inline</b> Property: This property is used to display an element as an inline element (like span).
       The height and width properties are not effected on display:inline; property. It allows only left and right side of margins, not top and bottom. In simple words it has no line break before and after of its neighbor elements and it allows HTML next to it.
  </p>
   <p>

    <b>display: inline-block</b> Property: This property is used to display an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but it can apply height and width values. It is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content).
    It looks like an inline element but it behaves as a block element and donâ€™t force to line break.
